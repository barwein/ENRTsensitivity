Description: Implements the sensitivity analysis framework for egocentric-network
    randomized trials (ENRTs) proposed by Weinstein and Nevo (2025).
    Provides tools to conduct grid sensitivity analysis (GSA) and
    probabilistic bias analysis (PBA) to assess the impact of ego-network
    contamination on indirect and direct effect estimates.
