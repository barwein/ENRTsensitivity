\title{Calculate Homogeneous Exposure Probabilities (pi)}
\usage{
pi_homo(rho_vec = NULL, m_vec = NULL, n_e, n_a = NULL, type, pz = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{rho_vec}{A numeric vector of homogeneous edge probabilities, \eqn{\rho^e} or
\eqn{\rho^a}. Each value should be in [0, 1].}

\item{m_vec}{A numeric vector of the expected number of missing edges, \eqn{m^e} or
\eqn{m^a}. Values must be non-negative.}

\item{n_e}{The total number of egos in the sample.}

\item{n_a}{The total number of alters in the sample (required if `type = "alter"`
and `m_vec` is used).}

\item{type}{A string, either `"ego"` or `"alter"`.
* If `"ego"`, calculates \eqn{\pi_i^e = 1 - (1 - p_z \rho^e)^{n_e - 1}}.
 * If `"alter"`, calculates \eqn{\pi_i^a = p_z + (1 - p_z)[1 - (1 - p_z \rho^a)^{n_e - 1}]}.}

\item{pz}{The known probability of an ego being assigned to treatment, \eqn{Pr(Z=1)}.}
}
\value{
A named list where each element is a scalar \eqn{\pi} value.
  The names of the list correspond to the values from `rho_vec` or `m_vec`.
}
\description{
Calculates the probability of exposure to at least one treated ego (\eqn{\pi_i})
under a homogeneous contamination model. This model assumes that the
probability of a latent edge (or the number of latent edges) is uniform
across all possible ego-ego or alter-ego pairs.

This function is used to generate sensitivity parameters for `enrt_sa` and
`enrt_pba` based on "Example 1 (Homogeneous probabilities)" and
"Example 2 (Homogeneous number of edges)" from the paper.

# --- Example 1: Homogeneous Probabilities ---

# has a 0.5\%, 1\%, or 2\% probability of existing?

# --- Example 2: Homogeneous Number of Edges ---
